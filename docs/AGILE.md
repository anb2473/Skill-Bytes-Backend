# Agile Practices
Hello, and thank you for contributing to the Skill Bytes project! We are currently using an AGILE framework to manage work. Below is a list of planned features, if you finish any feature please check it off on the list.

## Plan

| Item                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Status |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Finish Daily Challenge System          | Implement the backend for daily challenge retrieval, track each user’s completed challenges, and build frontend interfaces for loading challenges, editing code, testing solutions, and viewing leaderboards. | ✅     |
| Write Internal Tooling                 | Develop internal tooling—using the Ink framework—to streamline challenge publishing and provide automated warnings to ensure the challenge pool remains sufficiently populated.                       | ❌     |
| Code Cleanup – Auth Routes/Middleware  | Conduct a thorough review of authentication routes and middleware to ensure adherence to coding best practices and security guidelines.                                                             | ❌     |
| Code Cleanup – User Routes             | Audit and refine all user-related routes to maintain code quality, consistency, and security compliance.                                                                                            | ❌     |
| Code Cleanup – Admin Routes            | Review and polish administrative routes to uphold coding standards and strengthen application security.                                                                                             | ❌     |
| Code Cleanup – Root Routes             | Clean and standardize root-level routing logic to improve maintainability and overall application structure.                                                                                        | ❌     |
| Code Cleanup – Internal Tooling        | Evaluate and refine internal tooling code to ensure it meets project conventions and security expectations.                                                                                         | ❌     |

## Project Direction
The following is an outline for the long term goals of the project.
1. Implement a learn feature, allowing users to work through problem lists by topic
2. Add skill issues, providing feedback on users projects
3. Add byte clubs, connecting users, a d allowing users to collaborate on projects
4. Add premium plan, including executing problems in Docker to allow for more complex problems, and migrating the service to web to increase scalability
5. Implement free subdomains, allowing users to easily create landinv pages
